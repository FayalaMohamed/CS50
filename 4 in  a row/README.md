# 4 IN A ROW
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/7zx7c7-EFHo
#### Description: We begin by letting the user choose the size of the grid My project is a simple implementation of a terminal version of the game 4 in a row. Two players X and O choose to put "X" or "O" in the grid and in order to win they should have 4 of their "tokens" are in a row ( vertically , horizontally or diagonally). A gameplay example (right), shows the first player starting Connect Four by dropping one of their yellow discs into the center column of an empty game board. The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, until the second player, with red discs, achieves a diagonal four in a row, and wins the game. If the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw.  Every input is checked and any player can forfeit (by quitting).# So the input must be an integer that is between 0 and the number of columns-1 as they are used as the indices to an array. When inserting a token we return True if the column was not full and we did the insertion and False if the column was full before the insertion and so we let the same player choose another row. we use the tabulate module that we used in a cs50p problem set to print the game after each token insertion. The game ends by either a DRAW or by one of the players X or O winning.
